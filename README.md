# CAT Reloaded .NET Back-End Tasks

## Welcome!

Hey there! I'm Ahmed Gamal, and this repository is my personal log of the CAT Reloaded .NET Back-End track. It's a journey of bugs, fixes, and countless "why isnâ€™t this working?!" moments. But as they say, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single stepâ€”so donâ€™t be afraid to start, no matter how small!

Every great developer started somewhere, and this repo is proof that consistency, patience, and a few late-night debugging sessions pay off!

## What is this repo about?

This repository contains my weekly tasks for the CAT Reloaded .NET Back-End track. Each week, I take on new challenges and document my solutions. Some weeks are smooth sailing, while others feel like debugging purgatoryâ€”but thatâ€™s what makes it fun!

## Roadmap Reference

This track follows the official [CAT Reloaded .NET Back-End Roadmap](https://github.com/CATReloaded/CATReloaded-Circles-Roadmaps/tree/2025/Back%20End/DotNet). If you're also on this journey, you might find it useful!

## Why Does This Repo Exist?

- **To Stay Organized** â€“ I need proof that Iâ€™m actually doing the tasks (and not just debugging my life choices).
- **To Learn** â€“ Back-end development is full of "Aha!" moments... right before they turn into "Why is this breaking?" moments.
- **To Share My Progress** â€“ Not about showing off (okay, maybe just a little), but mostly about tracking how far Iâ€™ve come.

## Keep Going!

Ù‚Ø§Ù„ Ø±Ø³ÙˆÙ„ Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡ ï·º: "Ø£Ø­Ø¨ Ø§Ù„Ø£Ø¹Ù…Ø§Ù„ Ø¥Ù„Ù‰ Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡ Ø£Ø¯ÙˆÙ…Ù‡Ø§ ÙˆØ¥Ù† Ù‚Ù„" (ØµØ­ÙŠØ­ Ø§Ù„Ø¨Ø®Ø§Ø±ÙŠ)

As the Prophet Muhammad ï·º said: "The most beloved of deeds to Allah are those that are consistent, even if they are small." (Sahih Bukhari)

Coding is no different. Itâ€™s about showing up, learning every day, and improving bit by bit. So letâ€™s keep pushing forward!

## More to Come!

This is just the beginning. As I progress, I'll cover advanced topics like async programming, Entity Framework, and API development. Stick aroundâ€”things are about to get even more interesting.
