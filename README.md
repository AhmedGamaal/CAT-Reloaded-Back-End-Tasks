# CAT Reloaded .NET Back-End Tasks

## Welcome!

Hey there! I'm Ahmed Gamal, and this repository is my personal log of the CAT Reloaded .NET Back-End track. It's a journey of bugs, fixes, and countless "why isn’t this working?!" moments. But as they say, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step—so don’t be afraid to start, no matter how small!

Every great developer started somewhere, and this repo is proof that consistency, patience, and a few late-night debugging sessions pay off!

## What is this repo about?

This repository contains my weekly tasks for the CAT Reloaded .NET Back-End track. Each week, I take on new challenges and document my solutions. Some weeks are smooth sailing, while others feel like debugging purgatory—but that’s what makes it fun!

### Roadmap Reference

This track follows the official CAT Reloaded .NET Back-End Roadmap (insert link here). If you're also on this journey, you might find it useful!

## Weekly Progress

Here’s a snapshot of my progress so far:

- **Week 1:** C# Basics – Syntax, variables, and control structures. "The secret of getting ahead is getting started." – Mark Twain  
- **Week 2:** OOP – Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. "Every expert was once a beginner." – Helen Hayes  
- **Week 3:** Generics & Collections – Learning to manage data efficiently. "Small progress is still progress." – Unknown  

(More weeks coming soon...)

## Why Does This Repo Exist?

- **To Stay Organized** – I need proof that I’m actually doing the tasks (and not just debugging my life choices).
- **To Learn** – Back-end development is full of "Aha!" moments... right before they turn into "Why is this breaking?" moments.
- **To Share My Progress** – Not about showing off (okay, maybe just a little), but mostly about tracking how far I’ve come.

## Keep Going!

قال رسول الله ﷺ: "أحب الأعمال إلى الله أدومها وإن قل" (صحيح البخاري)

As the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ said: "The most beloved of deeds to Allah are those that are consistent, even if they are small." (Sahih Bukhari)

Coding is no different. It’s about showing up, learning every day, and improving bit by bit. So let’s keep pushing forward!

## More to Come

This is just the beginning. As I progress, I'll cover advanced topics like async programming, Entity Framework, and API development. Stick around—things are about to get even more interesting.
